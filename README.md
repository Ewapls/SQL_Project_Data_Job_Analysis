ðŸ¤“ SQL queries? Let's check them out here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
With the curiosity to know a little more about the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from that desire to look at top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analyst?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- **Power Bi:** For my data visualization in which you can dive into different data science rols not only Data Analyst, so you can get insights easily though visualizations and filters.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and locaiton, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
Select 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    companies.name as company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
From 
    job_postings_fact
Left Join 
    company_dim as companies on job_postings_fact.company_id = companies.company_id
Where 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'        AND
    salary_year_avg is not null
Order BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000 indicating significant salary potential in the field.
